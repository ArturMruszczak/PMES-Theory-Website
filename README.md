## About PMES Theory
PMES is a novel theoretical framework that models reality as excitations of a fundamental field Ψ in a 12-dimensional manifold M = A × B. The theory provides geometric explanations for:
- Emergence of spacetime and gravity
- Quantum phenomena and particle masses
- Structure of photons as 11D membrane-solitons
- Resolution of black hole singularities
